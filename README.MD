##### Chameleon is a Darwin/XNU boot loader based on Apple's boot-132.
----

Because Chameleon now uses part of GPL V2 licensed code in 2 files,
it *must* conform to the most restrictive license that it uses that is the:
__GPL Version 2 LICENSE__

Chameleon can thus be (and has to be) freely distributed under the term of the __GPL V2 license__ which prevails, as it is the most restrictive license.
